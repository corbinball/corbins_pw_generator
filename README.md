# Corbin Ball's Password

## Description
As a coder it is important to know how to use variables, arrays, if/else statements, and for loops. By creating my own password generator I was able to use and understand these elements.
Using my password generator you are able to create a password that is between 8-128 
characters; and if it will have lower case letters, have upper case letters, have numbers, and/or have special characters. Once you have filled out the selected criteria correctly, you will be generated a random password.
